Back to square one
Bite off more than one can chew
Public enemy number one
Pull a fast one
One step ahead
Quit while one is ahead
Put one over
One day
Win one for the gipper
Not as black as one is painted
Put one foot in front of the other
Number one with a bullet
Have it in one
Close one eye
Until one is blue in the face
Reap what one sows
Kill two birds with one stone
Go in one ear and out the other
One and the same
One man and his dog
Hang one on
As far as one knows
Take one for the team
Bite the big one
More than one bargained for
Put something behind one
One too many
One after another
In one go
Play one against another
Let one go
Tie one on

Give something a miss
Take something as read
Get something over with
Put something into perspective
Give something a try
Up to something
Give something a go
Run something up the flagpole
Take something in stride
Take something as it comes
Let something slip
Make something of oneself
Sweep something under the rug
Give something a whirl
